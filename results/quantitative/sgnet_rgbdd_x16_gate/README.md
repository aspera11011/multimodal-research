# SGNet RGB-D-D reliability-gate results

This directory contains aggregate, reviewable results only. Checkpoints, complete logs, datasets, and server-specific paths are intentionally excluded.

## Result files

- `summary.json`: original 200-sample spatial-gate pilot and control comparisons.
- `confirmatory_multiseed.json`: three-seed full-NYU evaluation on clean, translation, scale, and synthetic texture conditions.
- `adaptive_frequency_multiseed.json`: fixed-threshold adaptive full/high-frequency gate evaluation across three seeds.
- `adaptive_threshold_sensitivity.json`: fixed-threshold sweep from `0.70` to `0.80` using the same paired predictions.
- `runtime_benchmark.json`: 100-image CUDA timing and peak-memory comparison for baseline/full/high-frequency/adaptive modes.
- `qualitative_examples_summary.json`: selected success, branch-selection, and failure examples; generated panels remain local-only.

## Interpretation boundary

The adaptive frequency gate is retained for the cross-dataset synthetic 16× protocol. Every seed improves every mean metric in the seven selected clean, translation, scale, and texture conditions; 102 of 105 paired confidence intervals are strictly below zero.

The same claim does not extend to real sensor input. Direct transfer to `SGNet_Real_R` and a 200-sample real-domain calibration both perform significantly worse than the real-input baseline on all five reported metrics. These experiments are retained as No-Go evidence.

The native real-domain gate pilot, trained from identity initialization on 200 real training pairs, also performs worse on all five metrics. Real-domain gate training is therefore stopped pending a redesigned normalization or objective.

Held-out texture types give a narrower positive result. RMSE, boundary RMSE, and false-edge rate improve for a majority of seeds in all four sinusoidal/noise conditions, and stronger texture always increases high-frequency routing. However, only 34 of 60 per-seed metric comparisons are significant and the sinusoidal amplitude-8 condition worsens mean MAE/flat RMSE. This supports core edge robustness beyond checkerboards, not universal reconstruction improvement. Post-hoc diagnostics identify low cross-seed routing agreement at amplitude 8; they are not used to retune the reported threshold.
